# DYNAMIC TEXT ADVENTURE FRAMEWORK
# --------------------------
# This is a dynamic text adventure game framework that generates a random map, populates it with rooms, enemies, and items, and creates challenges for the player to solve.
# As this project progresses, the framework will be expanded to include more features, such as combat, puzzles, and a more complex narrative.
# The idea would be able to create a text adventure game by simply importing the framework and customizing the settings, enemies, items, and challenges.
# A database could be used to store the settings/session state, npcs, map daya, items, and challenges.
