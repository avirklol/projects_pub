All the projects I don't mind sharing.

## Current Projects
A growing list of projects that I'm happy to receive feedback on.

### The Intelligent Debtor

### Option Long Call/Put Prediction Model
Input a stock symbol and get an idea of when to drop a long call/put.

### Simple Text Adventure
A quick little text adventure game featuring a prisoner (you) and a guard (conversational AI, built off of an LLM).
