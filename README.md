All the projects I don't mind sharing.

## Current Projects
A growing list of projects that I'm happy to receive feedback on.

### Option Long Call/Put Prediction Model
**STATUS:** [BACKLOGGED]

Input a stock symbol and get an idea of when to drop a long call/put.

More details about the project can be found in the README doc within the stock_predictor directory.

### Text Adventure
**STATUS:** [BACKLOGGED]

A quick little text adventure game featuring a prisoner (you) and a guard (conversational AI agent, utlizing an LLM); a bit more work than I bargained for, but has allowed me to learn a greater deal about Langchain, RAG pipelines and function calls featuring an LLM model.
