All the projects I don't mind sharing.

## Current Projects
A growing list of projects that I'm happy to receive feedback on.

### The Intelligent Debtor
A simple tool to set a budget and provide insight into the best way to pay off purchases on a credit card; you set the amount you're willing to pay in interest and it'll give you the best payment plan according to your interest rates.

### Basic Stock Price Predictor
As easy as basic as it gets; you plug in a stock symbol and this thing should predict the price; we all know it won't be accurate.

### Simple Text Adventure
A quick little text adventure game featuring a prisoner (you) and a guard (conversational AI, built off of an LLM).
