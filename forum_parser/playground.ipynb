I don't know what developer exactly it will be, but only that I will need him for ten weeks for Epic A. How?I tried using BigPicture, but the only way to do that is to create a fake user, which consumes a license, and assigning this user as the assignee of this Epic. Which obviously doesn't work, as the Epic will first need to be reviewed by some other people that are assignees (and the allocation will be lost after that).If I want to plan the work for two developers, that's even worse, as this assignment will be based on the assignee field (and there can be only one person).I just want to plan an the Epic for multiple people, so I know it will take up their allocation in the future :(Example 2:We want to allocate two+ teams of users to an Initiative that is coming up in 2 months and will take up a month, so that we can mark that these teams have already allocated 50% of their time to this Initiative and that other Initiatives can be planned for these teams only for the remaining 50% of their capacities during that month.Again, using BigPicture, I was able to plan team A to one initiative, yet when I assign this initiative to team B, it disappears from team A's resource schedule.Please advise me with resolving this - can BigPicture do it? Can some other app do it? Thanks.\"},\n",

       "  'body': 'Issue Overview:I\\'m encountering a persistent problem with our Confluence app where the iframe height continuously expands indefinitely. This issue arises when we set the\\xa0html\\xa0and\\xa0body\\xa0elements to 100% height in our CSS, which we need to ensure the app content properly fills the screen. Instead, the iframe content initially loads at less than half the screen height and then starts expanding without limit. Looking at the developer tools (inspect), I can see that the Iframe height is increasing infinitely.Details:CSS Setup:We attempted to set the height of the\\xa0html\\xa0and\\xa0body\\xa0elements to 100% to make the content fill the screen.We also tried setting the body height to 100vh.Both approaches resulted in the iframe height expanding infinitelyHere is the CSS used:html,\\nbody {\\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\n    margin: 0;\\n    padding: 0;\\n    background-color: #f4f4f4;\\n    height: 100%;\\n}\\n\\nbody {\\n    height: 100vh; /* Tried both 100% and 100vh */\\n}\\n\\nnav ul {\\n    list-style-type: none;\\n    padding: 0;\\n}\\n\\nnav ul li {\\n    display: inline;\\n    margin-right: 10px;\\n}\\n\\nnav ul li a {\\n    text-decoration: none;\\n    color: #333;\\n}\\n\\n.container {\\n    margin: 20px;\\n    height: 100%;\\n    width: 100%;\\n}2. JavaScript for Handling Iframe Resizing:We included the\\xa0all.js\\xa0script from Atlassian to handle iframe resizing.Added a script to dynamically include the\\xa0all.js\\xa0file and call\\xa0AP.resize()\\xa0function to adjust the iframe size.Here is the JavaScript we used:document.addEventListener(\\'DOMContentLoaded\\', function () {\\n    const script = document.createElement(\\'script\\');\\n    script.src = \"https://connect-cdn.atl-paas.net/all.js\";\\n    script.async = true;\\n    document.head.appendChild(script);\\n\\n    function resizeIframe() {\\n        if (window.AP) {\\n            window.AP.resize();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    resizeIframe();\\n    setInterval(resizeIframe, 500); // Adjust the interval as needed\\n});\\xa0HTML Structure:Our HTML structure in the Handlebars template (main.hbs) is as follows:<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n\\n<head>\\n    <title>{{title}}</title>\\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/styles.css\">\\n</head>\\n\\n<body>\\n    <nav>\\n        <ul>\\n            <li><a href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</a></li>\\n            <li><a href=\"/documentation\">Documentation</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </nav>\\n    <div class=\"container\">\\n        {{{body}}}\\n    </div>\\n    <script src=\"/js/scripts.js\"></script>\\n</body>\\n\\n</html>\\xa0Current Behavior:When the app loads, the iframe height starts at less than half of the screen height.As soon as we set the\\xa0html\\xa0and\\xa0body\\xa0height to 100%, the iframe height starts expanding infinitely.Setting specific pixel values for height prevents infinite growth but doesn\\'t achieve the desired responsive design.Community Insights:Has anyone experienced similar issues with iframe height expanding indefinitely in Confluence apps?Are there any recommended approaches or best practices for handling iframe resizing in Confluence apps?Could there be any specific configuration or settings we might be missing that could resolve this issue?thank you for any help.'},\n",

I get the following error, how do I get the custom field values ID? I’m a project manager, not a developer.\\nThanks!\\nFailed to create a task in Asana\\nThe app returned “multi_enum_values: [0]: Not a recognized ID: Asset example”.\\nThe error message “multi_enum_values: [0]: Not a recognized ID: Asset example” indicates that the value “Asset examples” is not a valid ID for the custom field you are trying to update in Asana. This typically happens when the custom field expects a specific set of predefined options (IDs) and the provided value does not match any of these options.\\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the value you are passing to the custom field is a valid ID recognized by Asana. You can do this by fetching the list of valid IDs for the custom field from Asana and then using one of these IDs in your Zap. Here’s how you can do it:\\nFetch Valid IDs: Use Asana’s API to get the list of valid IDs for the custom field. You can do this by making a GET request to the custom field endpoint.\\nUpdate Zap: Once you have the valid IDs, update your Zap to use one of these IDs instead of “CIAM for Dummies”. You can use a Lookup Table in Zapier to map the human-readable values to the corresponding IDs.\\nFor example, if you have a custom field with options like “Option A” (ID: 12345) and “Option B” (ID: 67890), you would replace “Asset example” with the appropriate ID (e.g., 12345). This ensures that the value you are passing is recognized by Asana.'},\n",

I get the following error, how do I get the custom field values ID? I’m a project manager, not a developer.\\nThanks!\\nFailed to create a task in Asana\\nThe app returned “multi_enum_values: [0]: Not a recognized ID: Asset example”.\\nThe error message “multi_enum_values: [0]: Not a recognized ID: Asset example” indicates that the value “Asset examples” is not a valid ID for the custom field you are trying to update in Asana. This typically happens when the custom field expects a specific set of predefined options (IDs) and the provided value does not match any of these options.\\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the value you are passing to the custom field is a valid ID recognized by Asana. You can do this by fetching the list of valid IDs for the custom field from Asana and then using one of these IDs in your Zap. Here’s how you can do it:\\nFetch Valid IDs: Use Asana’s API to get the list of valid IDs for the custom field. You can do this by making a GET request to the custom field endpoint.\\nUpdate Zap: Once you have the valid IDs, update your Zap to use one of these IDs instead of “CIAM for Dummies”. You can use a Lookup Table in Zapier to map the human-readable values to the corresponding IDs.\\nFor example, if you have a custom field with options like “Option A” (ID: 12345) and “Option B” (ID: 67890), you would replace “Asset example” with the appropriate ID (e.g., 12345).

       "  'As of this morning my Team calendar properly showed the due dates for all the tasks assigned throughout our collective projects. Today I created a new rule in each project that would trigger a Google Calendar event to be made each time a task was moved to a certain section (I’m trying to figure out a solve for maintaining only one calendar between internal staff and external vendors who don’t have access to Asana). It seems like that did something because now my calendar only shows a handful of the due dates on the Team calendar. It appears to be a bug from browsing the forum. Am I able to get help with this? Thank you!']]"
