       "  'body': \"👋 Community! Elana from Confluence Automation here today with a super exciting announcement: You can now “batch” email notifications so that your team doesn’t get multiple emails from the same notification trigger!\\n\\xa0\\nWhat does this mean?\\nHave you ever accidentally spammed yourself or team members by creating an automation rule that sends an email for every page, action, or task found by a trigger?\\nWell no more! We've expanded our rule logic capabilities so that you can send a single email with all the content you need.\\nWe've also added new “look-up” actions and smart values that allow you to search through your pages and tasks without taking explicit action on them!\\n\\xa0\\nWhat does this look like?\\nLet’s run through an example\\nYou want to make sure all your content is up-to-date and relevant so that your team has the information they need. It's too tedious to manually search through every page, so you decide you want to create an automation rule that sends an email notification to inactive page owners about their stale content.\\nHow would you do this?\\n1. In the rule builder, you’d add a “When” trigger and input your desired schedule time.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n2. From there, you’d add a “Branch rule / for each inactive page” component. This branch will loop through all your pages and compile a list of the inactive ones.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n3. Then, we can add an advanced branch rule and input the smart value {{inactivePagesPerAuthor}} with the variable name authorInactivePages. This smart value will compile a list of lists with the inactive pages and their owners name. We will later use this smart value to send targeted emails.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n4. Next, we can add a condition that checks to ensure that the smart value is not empty. This will ensure that we don’t accidentally send an email with no recipient.\\n\\xa0\\n5. Almost done! Last step would be to add a “Then: send email” component. Input the variable “{{authorInactivePages.first().author.emailAddress}}” into the “To” section. This will find the inactive pages author’s email address and notify them about their stale content!\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nAdditional Updates \\nWe updated 4 rule templates to have “batching notifications” by default:\\xa0\\n\\nNotify people about inactive pages\\nRemind teammates about incomplete tasks when scheduled\\xa0\\nMark inactive verified pages ready for review and send an email when scheduled\\xa0\\nNotify people when a page passes a threshold of views\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe added new “page” and “task” look-up actions\\nNew “page” and “task” look up actions enable you to search through your space and compile a list of pages or tasks given a certain criteria. To use, navigate to “lookup pages” in the rule builder and select your desired component!\\nNew Look-Up Actions and Smart Values:\\n\\n{{lookupPagesPerOwner/Author}}\\n{{lookupTasks}}\\n{{lookupTasksPerAssignee}}\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhen will this be available?\\nThis is fully available and live for all Premium and Enterprise Confluence customers with automation enabled and we hope you find “batching” notifications valuable in your mission to always keep your content up to date!\\n\\xa0\\nWe want to hear from you! \\nWe’d love your feedback so please feel free to\\xa0schedule time with us directly here\\xa0or drop a comment on this post 🙏\"},\n",
